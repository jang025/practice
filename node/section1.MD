# Node.js Under the hood

Writing assembly code for this operating system and this CPU architecture

Each operating system and CPU architecture needs its own unique command

Compiler for cpp --> g++

Javascript and node.js are written in cpp

Executable files also depend on the operating system and CPU architecture

Running Javascript (converting our js code into machine code)
To do so , we use a javascript engine

Different browsers use different javascript engine

Chrome and node.js use the V8 engine (js engine)

Ecmascript - (Set of rules) unity and consistency of the way different javascript engines execute javascript code

node.js --> create javascript programs for servers (server-side technology) (C++ application that has V8 embedded in it)

which node --> the path that my node executable file is located
