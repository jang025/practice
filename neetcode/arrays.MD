# RAM

Data structures are a way to store data in an efficient manner inside of a computer component called Random Access Memory (RAM). RAM is often just referred to as memory.

Computer only understand data in terms of bits (0 and 1)

1 byte = 8 bits

Integers commonly occupy 4 bytes (32 bits) in memory

An address and a value gets associated with an integer upon storing it in RAM. An address is just a distinct location that each one of the values is stored at.

Each value is stored contiguously in the RAM, just like an array.

Each integer occupies 4 bytes of space, hence the addresses are 4 bytes apart.

Each character occupies 1 byte of space, hence the addresses are 1 byte apart.
